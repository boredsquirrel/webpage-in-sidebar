# Webpage in Firefox Sidebar

![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/semanticdata/firefox-whatsapp-in-sidebar)

A Firefox extension template to add any website to the sidebar. Meant as a workaround until this is supported natively (like in Brave, Zenbrowser and more).

## Usage

1. Toggle the sidebar by pressing _`Alt+Shift+W`_. This shortcut can be changed by going to _`Add-ons` â†’ TODO
2. If you prefer buttons over shortcuts, there is a toolbar button you can press to toggle the sidebar.

## How to Unlock Firefox Sidebar

in `about:config` change this value

`sidebar.revamp true`

use `sidebar.position_start` true/false to switch left/right side
