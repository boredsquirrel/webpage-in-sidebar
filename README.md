A Firefox WebExtension to open WhatsApp Web within the Firefox sidebar. This extension adds a new section to the sidebar which contains the WhatsApp web app. It also adds a shortcut, and a button toggle within the toolbar.

## How to Use

1. Toggle the sidebar by pressing Alt+Shift+W. This shortcut can be changed by going to Add-ons -> WhatsApp in Sidebar -> Options.
2. If you prefer buttons over shortcuts, there is a toolbar button you can press to toggle the sidebar.

## How to Unlock Firefox Sidebar Width

The sidebar's width is *locked by default* in Firefox. Unfortunately, the sidebar is very restrictive and I can only do so much to enhance the functionality of this extension. I put together a step-by-step guide on how to unlock it over at [my blog](https://stressed.dev/unlock-max-width-of-firefoxs-sidebar/).

## Disclaimer

This Add-on is primarily for personal use; a personal project if you will. I'm just trying to use WhatsApp inside the Firefox sidebar instead of having a pinned tab with it open. This add-on just launches their webapp in the sidebar. ***This extension is an independent project, has no relationship, and is not affiliated to WhatsApp in any way. WhatsAppâ„¢ is a registered trademark of Meta.***
