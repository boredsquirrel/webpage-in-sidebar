# Whatsapp in Sidebar

A Firefox WebExtension to display [Whatsapp](https://web.whatsapp.com/) in the sidebar. This extension adds a new section to the Firefox sidebar which contains the Whatsapp web app.

Press `Alt+Shift+7` to open. This shortcut can be changed by going to Add-ons -> Whatsapp in Sidebar -> Options.

## Notice #1

Due to the nature of how stupid we humans are the following disclaimers are being made:

### Disclaimer #1

This Add-on is primarily for personal use; a personal project if you will.

## Disclaimer #2

I'm literally just trying to use WhatsApp on the Firefox sidebar.

## Disclaimer #3

This add-on just launches WhatsApp Web in the sidebar.

## Disclaimer #4

This extension is an independent project and has no relationship to WhatsApp.

## Disclaimer #6

This WebExtension is an independent project and not affiliated with Meta Platforms, Inc.

## Notice #2

These disclaimers were formatted with the goal of making it abundantly clear, how stupid it is to assume that this addon has any material connections to WhatApp/Facebook. Oh, I'm sorry, I remembered it's Meta Platforms, Inc. ðŸ™„
