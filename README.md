# Whatsapp in Sidebar

## _This repo is not actively maintained_

## Notice
This addon is ***NOT*** currently published at addons.mozilla.org - I received a DMCA takedown notice from Facebook/WhatsApp/Meta. I suspect a disclaimer in the description would suffice, since many other WhatsApp Firefox extensions remain public with only a small disclaimer in their description. Nevertheless, I'm not risking my Firefox account to submit the new version with a disclaimer within the description. Feel free to fork/build your own version.

A Firefox WebExtension to display [Whatsapp](https://web.whatsapp.com/) in the sidebar. This extension adds a new section to the Firefox sidebar which contains the Whatsapp web app.

Press `Alt+Shift+7` to open. This shortcut can be changed by going to Add-ons -> Whatsapp in Sidebar -> Options.

## Disclaimer

This Add-on is primarily for personal use; a personal project if you will. I'm just trying to use WhatsApp on the Firefox sidebar. This add-on just launches their webapp in the sidebar. This extension is an independent project, has no relationship, and is not affiliated to WhatsApp in any way.
